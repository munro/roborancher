 * tile entry should be direction sensitive for walls, etc
 * entry attempts should return {(true||false),callback()} to report
 * actual physical movement and call functions on the bots in response.
 * 
 * tiles also need properties and event generation (ie. make entires onto 
 * priority queue)
 * 
 * I don't think that they need callbacks at this stage
